                            I couldn't wait for you to come clear the cupboards<br>
                            But now you're going to leave with nothing but a sign<br>
                            Another evening I'll be sitting reading in between your lines<br>
                            Because I miss you all the time<br>
                            <br>
                            So, get away<br>
                            Another way to feel what you didn't want yourself to know<br>
                            And let yourself go<br>
                            You know you didn't lose your self-control<br>
                            Let's start at the rainbow<br>
                            Turn away<br>
                            Another way to be where you didn't want yourself to go<br>
                            Let yourself go<br>
                            Is that a compromise<br>
                            <br>
                            So what do you wanna do, what's your point-of-view?<br>
                            There's a party soon, do you wanna go?<br>
                            A handshake with you, what's your point-of-view?<br>
                            I'm on top of you, I don't wanna go<br>
                            'Cause I really wanna stay at your house<br>
                            And I hope this works out<br>
                            But you know how much you broke me apart<br>
                            I'm done with you, I'm ignoring you<br>
                            I don't wanna know<br>
                            <br>
                            And I'm aware that you were lying in the gutter<br>
                            'Cause I did everything to be there by your side-ide<br>
                            So when you tell me I'm the reason I just can't believe the lies<br>
                            And why do I so want to call you (Call you, call you, call you)<br>
                            <br>
                            So what do you wanna do, what's your point-of-view?<br>

                            I don't know why I'm no-one<br>
